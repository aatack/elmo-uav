\section{Wing} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing}

The wing assembly was designed to be unfasten from the fuselage assembly with ease.
Such decision was established so to reduce the encumbrance of the UAV during transportation.
The wing assembly is composed by two carbon spars placed respectively at quarter and half chord, and extending for the entire 2m wing span.
Each half of the wing presents three ribs, as shown in Fig.
0, obtained with the aid of additive manufacturing.
These cover multiple functions in the wing assembly as it will be later discussed.
The use of profiles carved out of blue Styrofoam (extruded polystyrene) provided a lightweight structure for the aerodynamic profiles such as flaps, aileron and wing itself.
A hollow profile also allowed the fitting of wires in the wing structure.
A central mounting plate provided the fitting points for the fastening of the wing assembly to the fuselage.

\subsection{Spars} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:spars}

The two-spar structure utilized for the wind tunnel model’s wing exhibited small deflections in bending and twist when tested.
Therefore, this same configuration was maintained for the flight model.
Two carbon spars were used for the final design, thus reducing the weight although maintaining the same structural characteristics.
These have been sized for a case of a loading equal to 4g; at which the wing would present a deflection of 54mm at the wing tip as it can be seen in Fig. 1.
Both spars have a wall thickness of 2mm whereas their diameters differ.
The first one, position at quarter chord, has a diameter of 16mm; while the one positioned at half chord has a diameter of 14mm.

\subsection{Ribs} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:ribs}

The attachment points for the power units are obtained through the use of 3D printed inserts imbedded in the wing structure.
These, as shown in Fig. 2, present the same airfoil section as the wing so to not disrupt the airflow.
Three inserts per half wingspan allow as many different possible propulsion positions: 20\% half-span, 40\% half-span and 100\% half-span (tip).
Thus allowing the assessment of the effects of the propulsion unit placed close to the fuselage structure (20\% half-span); at the optimal position shown in Propeller-wing interaction for minimum induced loss (Kroo, 1986) (40\% half-span) and wing tip (100\% half-span).
The design of this last is, although, different from the ‘mid-span’ elements.
For each of the mid-span inserts, the same motor unit can be mounted in four different configurations: top-tractor, bottom-tractor, top-pusher, bottom-pusher (Fig. 3).
While for the tip mounted element the available configurations are two: pusher, tractor (Fig. 4).
Adapters are adopted to blend the standardized connection surface of the motor housing with the wing’s surface.
Thus, reducing the aerodynamic footprint.

\end{figure}

Each ‘mid-span’ insert in equipped four brass threaded inserts on both bottom and top surface.
These permit the fastening of the power unit cells and the respective adapter.
The location of the holes is the same for top and bottom surface (when viewed from the top).
Doing so, the same motor housing can be mounted on the top and bottom surface without alterations.
Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 5, the inserts are located at equal distance from the centreline positioned at half chord.
Thus, allowing the mounting of the same power unit cell in tractor or pusher configurations without the need for alterations. 

\importimage{wing-insert}{section view of the wing insert.}{Wing insert}{0.9}

The tip insert is designed so to mount the motor housing in horizontal position.
In order to use the same configuration of mounting points the tip adapter covers a structural role (unlike the rest).
This presents the brass inserts configuration discussed above so to guarantee the attachment of the standardized PUC.
The adapter is then mounted to the insert though two M6 bolts fastened to the two imbedded nuts shown in Fig. 2b. 

In order to reduce the elements composing the wing assembly, these components cover the function of ribs as well providing further torsional rigidity to the wing structure.
The two holes shown in Fig. 5 permit the carbon spars to run through the rib insert.
Thus, providing a secure attachment and sufficient bonding area.
Furthermore, as it will be later exposed, the housing for the active surfaces’ servos and flaps’ guides are designed to be integral part of the rib structure. 

\subsection{Mounting plate} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:mounting-plate}

A Nylon printed mounting plate is located at the centre of the wing assembly.
This is tightly mounted to the wing spars so to guarantee a rigid support.
The wing assembly is then clamped onto the fuselage attachment plate through four M6 bolts.
These are positioned at the corners of the 3D printed plate as it is shown in Fig. 6.
A Styrofoam cover placed on top of the mounting plate is responsible for the blending of the wing assembly with the rest of the fuselage. 

\importimage{wing-assembly}{exploded view of the wing assembly attachment procedure}{Wing assembly attachment}{0.8}

The two cylinders housing the carbon spars ensure an even distribution of the loads though a large area (Fig. 7a).
This was essential since this component is subject to the totality of the load transferring from the wing to the fuselage and vice versa.
Therefore, extensive work was conducted using finite element analysis to generate a reliable and light design.
The peak loading for this component was established to be 4g, simulating an abrupt increase in lift Fig. 7b.
Hence producing the design shown in Fig. 7a.

\subsection{Flap mathematical modelling} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:flap-mathematical-modelling}

Flaps were an obvious addition to aid take-off and landing.
It was decided to use single slotted flaps to increase flap efficiency and high lift capability.
The wing was split into three main sections between the motor mounts.
Because of the restrictions to span, the flap to wing chord ratios were the values that were altered to change high light performance.
It was also decided to use a small symmetrical deflection of the ailerons as the flaps were limited in performance.
It was considered to convert the trailing edges of the mounting locations into flaps too, however the increase in complexity led to the decision to ignore this idea. 

To begin, the flap geometry was parametrized by defining a chord ratio of the flaps to the wing, as well as the inboard and outboard spans of each flap.
The mathematical outcome of the process gave a required angle of the fuselage either on rotation or induced by a tail gear configuration, so work on the flaps aimed to reduce this angle, especially given the clearance required by the tail propeller demanding long landing gear legs. 

To mathematically model the flaps, first, a take-off speed was obtained from data provided by a teammate’s work on propulsion performance.
His initial calculation had provided a take-off speed of 10 m s-1 was not possible to design the flaps around with a reasonable required incidence.
After a dialogue, the take-off speed was agreed to be raised to 13 m s-1. 

To analyse the flap geometry, a process was devised from this authors own understanding, using flap parameters from M.
Sadraey’s book: ‘Aircraft design: A systems engineering perspective’.
According to table 5.15 in (Sadraey, 2013), the increase in local sectional lift coefficient for a slotted flap is 1.3 times the chord ratio of the flap to the wing, and the increase in local sectional lift coefficient for a plain flap (such as a converted aileron) is 0.7-0.9. 0.7 was selected out of this range to be conservative. 

It is important to note that this increase in lift coefficient is for a flap deflection of 60 degrees.
This is unrealistic for this application.
Additionally, because roll authority is required in all flight phases, so the full aileron deflection would not be usable for high lift gain, so a small angle of 5o downwards deflection was selected.
The maximum deflection of the slotted flaps was selected as 40o based on data in table 5.16 from (Sadraey, 2013).
The increase in lift coefficient for the respective flap was then multiplied by the ratio of the maximum deflection to 60o.
The value for the slotted flap was further multiplied by the chord ratio as required by the method. 

A simple version of the lift equation was then defined to account for the flap and aileron deflection at take-off: 

\importequation{
    \begin{aligned}
    L_{TO}  & {}= q S_{NoHLDs} (C_{L_0}+C_{L_\alpha}\alpha) \\
            & \quad + qS_f ((C_{L_0}+C_{L_\alpha}\alpha) + \Delta C_{L_f}) \\
            & \quad + qS_a ((C_{L_0}+C_{L_\alpha}\alpha) + \Delta C_{L_\alpha}) \\
            & {}= qSC_{L_0} + qSC{L_\alpha}\alpha + q S_a \Delta C_{L_\alpha} + q S_f \Delta C_{L_f}
    \end{aligned}
}{takeoff-lift}
% TODO: put line breaks into equation

which can be rearranged for $alpha$:

\importequation{\alpha = \frac{L_{TO} - q S C_{L_0} - q S_a \Delta C_{L_\alpha} - q S_f \Delta C_{L_f}}{q S C_{L_\alpha}}}{rearranged-takeoff-lift}

The take-off lift was estimated as 10 N greater than the maximum take-off weight of the UAV to provide responsive climb performance. Sa and Sf were determined by multiplying the total span for the flaps and ailerons by the wing chord, and $\Delta$CLa and $\Delta$CLf from the earlier calculations.
$\alpha$ resulted as 7.88o required wing total incidence on take-off, based on a final selected value of flap to wing chord ratio of 0.4, which was the maximum reasonable value before the flaps would begin impinging on electronics or wing spars.

The wing chord line had been set at an angle of 2o relative to the fuselage, the required incidence of the fuselage, either provided by the landing gear or rotation would be 7.8768o – 2o = 5.8768o. 

\subsection{Flap CAD} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:flap-cad}

The shape of the flap was defined from a copy of the wing CAD.
Since a slotted flap had been chosen, a shroud from the wing had to extend to near the leading edge of the flaps in a deployed position such that boundary layer re-energisation on top of the flap would be optimal.
The wing shroud had been defined in CAD, so the profile of this was transferred onto the flap profile, smoothed out and then cut off from the leading edge and upper surface.  

Based on feedback on an original design, the flap mechanism of a Cessna-172 was selected as inspiration for the next version (Towell, 2019).
Images of this were studied, and a mechanism designed producing a smooth deployment both translationally back and down, and rotationally back to the 40 degree angle specified. 

\importimage{flap-mechanism-side}{the flap mechanism.}{Flap mechanism side view}{0.6}

The pins were made as central as possible in the flap so that they would not melt the walls of the flap in foam cutting.
These pins were also eventually changed to stiffening spars that would protrude beyond the end of the flaps to run along the tracks in the mechanism, but also stiffen the flap under aerodynamic loads.

\section{Fuselage} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage}

\subsection{Central structure} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:central-structure}

The main focus for the design of the UAV’s fuselage was to provide a reliable and simple platform for the experiments.
The concept for the design of the fuselage revolved around the idea of providing easy access to the electronics.
Changing the motor configuration multiple time demands the ability to check and modify the electronics with ease in order to proceed with the experiments in a smooth manner.
Therefore, the design presents a large electronics tray placed in the lower section of the fuselage; shown in purple in Fig. 8.
This can be accessed through the removal of the UAV’s nose.

\importimage{fuselage-inner-structure}{CAD representation of the inner structure of the fuselage's central section.}{Fuselage inner structure}{0.8}

All the fuselage’s structural components are located in the top section of this last.
Doing so a large area was created for the housing of the electronics as shown in Fig. 8.
The supports for the electronics tray, also referred as ‘fuselage ribs’, are designed to be manufactured out of 5mm birch wood sheets.
Such supports (represented in brown in Fig. 8), are mounted onto the fuselage central beam.
This is a square section carbon spar (20mm x 20mm) which extends for the entire fuselage length. 

A carbon fibre sandwich panel is placed onto the top surface of the fuselage’s central spar.
This is bonded at the wing’s attachment area with the aid of epoxy bonding agent.
In fact, its function is to provide the four mounting points for the bolts so to allow the fixing of the wing assembly to the fuselage.
The sandwich panel obtained by using a 5mm thickness nomex core placed between two carbon skins.
These last are each made out of 3ply woven carbon prepreg cured in autoclave.
Mounted below the plate are two PLA printed brackets (Fig. 9a); these are responsible for the correct positioning of the fuselage ribs and the landing gear mounting structure.
This is better shown in Fig. 9b.
Furthermore, they are designed to withstand a vertical load of 170N each; thus, offering a redundant attachment for the mounting plate in case of failure.

\importimage{pla-bracket}{CAD representation of the PLA bracket.}{PLA bracket}{0.5}
\importimage{brackets-highlighted}{fuselage central assembly with brackets highlighted in green.}{Highlighted brackets}{0.7}

\subsection{Landing gear attachment} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:landing-gear-attachment}

The aircraft was design to not exceed 7kg of total mass.
Thus the position and the mass of the landing gear structure proved to be of significance in the position of the aircraft centre of gravity.
The ideal position of this was set to be at 50\% of the wing’s chord length; with a 5\% shift caused by the change in propulsion configuration.
The landing gear is mounted on two ‘C’ shaped 5mm aluminium brackets.
These are mounted to two bulkheads as shown in Fig. 10a.
These last cover the role of transferring and absorbing the vertical loads encountered during taxi, take off and landing.
In order to minimize the weight of this structure the bulkheads are designed to be manufactured as carbon fibre sandwich panels.
These have been specified to withstand vertical loads up to 5g.
Furthermore, two triangular braces, as shown in Fig. 10b, are attached to the lowest section of the bulkheads and are clamped to the main spar through a PLA insert.
These work in compression and are designed to counteract the moments generated by the loads acting on the wheels in the direction of travel.

The carbon fibre sandwich panels bulkheads are design in the same manner as the fuselage central plate discussed previously.
A schematic of this is provided in Fig. 11. 

\importimage{carbon-fibre-sandwich}{CAD representation of the carbon fibre sandwich panel components.}{Carbon fibre sandwich}{0.5}

\subsection{Finite element analysis} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:finite-element-analysis}

In order to verify the strength of the design and identify any weak points, some FEA was carried out using the Simulation function in SolidWorks.
This is a fairly basic FEA system and can only use coarse meshes otherwise the simulations fail, but it gives a good indication of the strong and weak areas of the fuselage design.
The materials of the parts of the fuselage were all specified and the data for those materials applied as accurately as possible in order to ensure the parts relative strengths were reflected in the simulations.
The model is stripped down to the minimum components required to perform the simulations in order to save computational time and simplify the simulations.
Initially a simulation was run to test the effects of high turning loads, with the main tail boom fixed in place as the reference point of the study and loads of 210N applied vertically upwards on the wing spar holes in the wing mount, and 80N applied vertically down on the component tray.
These loads were chosen to simulate 3g loads in a turn, with the mass of the components assumed evenly distributed over the tray.
Figure 1 shows the results.

\importimage{fuselage-stress-distribution}{fuselage stress distribution during a simulated 3g turn.}{Fuselage stress distribution}{0.7}

It can be seen that the wing mount shows that the maximum stress experienced is around 1.6 MPa, which is significantly below the 30 MPa yield stress of the ABS material used.
The other high stress locations are on the lower parts of the component tray mounts, which peak at over 2 MPa, but the plywood used has a yield stress of 30 MPa and so this is also well below the point of breaking.
It can also be seen that the stress on the carbon fibre tail boom reaches over 2 MPa, but this is well below the yield stress of the carbon tube which will be over 600 MPa based on the properties quoted at [Performance Composites [REF]]. 

The second simulation is showing the effects of landing loads, with the tail boom again fixed and the loads applied at the locations of the wheel centres on the landing gear.
This simulation only tests the main gear as this is where the highest forces should be experienced if the UAV is landed properly.
The forces applied are 350N vertically up and 105N horizontally rearwards to simulate a heavy landing of 5g with 1.5g deceleration force. 

\importimage{landing-leg-simulation}{simulated stress distribution over one of the landing legs.}{Landing leg simulation}{0.4}
\importimage{fuselage-landing-simulation}{stress distribution over the fuselage during a simulated landing.}{Fuselage landing simulation}{0.6}

It can be seen in Figure 2 that the peak loads experienced by the landing gear are around 260MPa, which is below the yield stress of the carbon fibre as previously stated, and although it is nearing the yield stress, this is an extreme case of a particularly heavy landing and so a heavier landing than this would not be expected unless it occurs in a crash landing scenario in which case the UAV surviving would be down to luck.
It can also be seen that the peak stress on the landing gear brackets is around 100MPa, below the yield stress of around 270MPa of the aluminium they are made of.
With the scale modified to a reduced upper bound, the stresses on the other parts can be seen, with the peak stress experienced by the landing gear mounts seen as around 10 MPa, which is massively below the yield stress of carbon fibre and although the properties of carbon fibre sandwich panel are varied, they are quoted as having a yield stress of at least 100 MPa, and so this is not close to failure. 

\section{Landing gear} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:landing-gear}

There are two main types of landing gear design considered for this project: the tricycle and a tail wheel approach. A tricycle consists of a single front wheel, and two rear wheels, as seen on most commercial aircraft.
Whereas a tail wheel design uses a single rear wheel with two front wheels.

\importtable{| >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.12\columnwidth} | >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.36\columnwidth} | >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.36\columnwidth} |}{

    \hline
}{tradeoffs involved in the gear layout used.}{gear-layout-tradeoffs}

When the landing gear was first being designed  weight was the limiting factor, with the UAV close to the 7kg mass limit, because of this the decision was made to use a tail wheel approach as it is lighter than the tricycle approach.

The modularity and moving centre of gravity was a unique challenge to this UAV.
The first step of the design was the calculation of the maximum loading conditions the landing gear would encounter (Goud, 2014). 

\importimage{moment-calculations}{moment calculations.}{Moment calculations}{0.7}

The forward most CG meant x=150mm and y=765mm, this led to a maximum static loading of 57.4N over the front wheels and 11.26N over the rear wheel.
The rearmost CG led to x=200mm and y=815mm, the maximum static loadings for this condition is 55.13N and 13.53N over the front and rear wheels, respectively.
Based on these calculations, a load of 57.4N and 13.53N were used in future calculations and analysis. 

A vertical velocity of 3m/s was assumed to be an aggressive landing velocity in the hands of a competent pilot and was used in calculation to ensure the landing gear would be strong enough to withstand multiple rough landings.
Using Newtons 2nd law, and an assume impact time of 0.5 seconds, the maximum force of the UAV is equal to 42N, meaning a total force of 110.67N on landing.
Most UAVs land with their main wheels touching down first, the main landing gear must absorb most of the load, on previous calculations the main gear should withstand 99.4N.  

\importimage{landing-gear-design-one}{landing gear design one.}{Landing gear design}{0.8}

A setting angle of 5.8degrees was needed to meet take-off requirements, as shown in figure 1.
To avoid hitting the rear propeller or the rudder, the rear wheel was designed to extrude from the bottom of the under-rudder.
The carbon fibre spar in the rudder would be string enough to support the maximum 10N load it would encounter on landing. 

\importimage{landing-gear-attachment-locations}{potential landing gear attachment locations.}{Landing gear attachment locations}{0.7}

It immediately became clear that the main gear would have to be mounted to the main carbon fibre boom running the length of the fuselage.
However, after a supervisor meeting it was advised that the main wheels should be located below the leading edge of the wing.
However, as figure 2 shows, mounting the main gear would not be possible in this location.
A solution to have the main gear mounted further forward but curved backwards was devised.  

Several iterations similar to the final design, in figure 3, were designed and tested using FEA.
The FEA was initially carried out on a single leg, with a loading of 50N applied to a fiberglass construction.
After the design of the leg was finalised a clamping system was devised to mount the main gear to the boom.
Further FEA showed that the clamping would be effective at attaching the fibreglass to the boom but would cause the boom to buckle on landing.
Figure 5 shows how the addition of a prepreg cover around the boom significantly reduces the stress of the boom itself, by roughly a factor of 10.

\importimage{prepreg-cover-stress}{effect of a prepreg cover on carbon fibre spar.}{Prepreg cover stress}{0.95}

At this point in the design process, the weight of the UAV was no longer an issue, and after a supervisor meeting in which the landing gear design was discussed, it was decided that the landing gear should be steerable.
This would reduce time to retrieve the UAV on landing as well as making take-off easier.
The tail wheel set up is not optimum for a steerable configuration.
Therefore, as the fuselage and the weight of the aircraft had been reduced making weight less of an important factor, the decision was made to redesign the landing gear in a tricycle configuration.

Using a similar process to the tail wheel design, the main landing gear was calculated to experience up to 105.8N on landing.
The main gear is now located behind the centre of gravity, behind the internal electronics.
This, along with a redesigned fuselage means the landing gear could be designed as a single part and attached easily to the bottom of the fuselage. 

% \importimage{main-gear-design}{main gear design.}{Main gear design}{0.4}
\importimage{main-gear-fea}{main gear FEA stress results.}{Main gear FEA}{0.6}

The main shape of the design didn’t change from the initial design, a similar design which is seen on many small UAVs as it is simple, easy to implement and robust.
FEA was carried out on the design and small changes made until an optimum design was found.
The final design would experience a maximum stress of 92.5Mpa on a rough landing.
The final design would later be manufactured from carbon fibre because it can be manufactured cheaply on at university and it has a high strength to weight ratio.
The knowledge of this manufacturing decision gave more freedom to the design.
The final design had a maximum thickness of 6mm at the top where it joins the fuselage, narrowing to 4mm by the wheels.
The depth remained constant at 65mm, with a wheelbase of 490mm and a height of 220mm this was to avoid hitting the under rudder on take-off.
The redesigned fuselage structure with two lower plates meant the landing gear could easily be mounted to the fuselage using two M4 bolts. 

Before manufacturing began on the component, a similar model was found online. A cost benefit analysis was carried out, along with a time benefit analysis, and it was determined that purchasing the landing gear would allow the focus on other areas of design that needed finalising. 

\importimage{landing-gear-join}{landing gear joining mechanism.}{Landing gear joining mechanism}{0.6}

The nose gear was chosen at recommendation of co supervisor Mario Ferraro, it is the same at that used on the SPOTTER aircraft, a 24kg split fuselage UAV (SPOTTER, 2019). It was easy to implement into the nose design and make steerable, whilst being cheap, lightweight, and strong. 

\section{Nose} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:nose}

The nose was a key component in the project and needed to fulfil several criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item support a motor and propellor unit;
    \item provide access to the motor for removal;
    \item be removable from the rest of the fuselage whilst being strong enough to support the motor during flight;
    \item integrate the landing gear.
\end{itemize}

To fulfil all the above criteria, it was obvious from the start that the nose would have to be 3D printed, this meant there were no restrictions regarding the design.  

The initial design was simple, incorporated the ability to attach the motor via four internal screw holes.
The nose would be attached to the fuselage via a spar running through the nose and the front of the spar.
Although not optimal, at the time it was deemed acceptable to drill through the end of the carbon spar as it was away from the structural core of the fuselage.
The design also incorporated a slot for the battery to slide into to act as a ballast, as well as a slot for the ESC which would maximise airflow to it therefore cooling.

Figure 11 shows a redesigned model of the nose.
Firstly, the outer body has been light weighted considerably from 5mm to 1.5mm and supports added.
The battery compartment has become a tray, which will make removal easier.
The tray has a section underneath for the ESC to be placed, with cooling vents in the front of the nose.
The nose will be secured to the fuselage via two bolts the width of the fuselage.
More light weighting was done to the motor support and rods used instead of the previous bulky design. 

% \importimage{revised-nose-design}{revised nose design.}{Revised nose design}{0.7}

After advice from our supervisor, alterations were made to the initial design.
Noticeably a battery and ESC tray was added to the back of the nose, with vents in the front of the nose to allow cooling to the ESC.
The tray was supported by two vertical poles to support the weight of the battery. 

% \importimage{twice-revised-nose}{twice revised nose design.}{Twice revised nose design}{0.7}

The nose would now be secured by one bolt, through the carbon fibre spar, this would also act as a support for the motor mount as well.
However, after further deliberation with our supervisor, it was decided that the loss I structural performance from drilling through the carbon fibre boom was not worth the reduction in workload so a new way of attaching the nose to the fuselage needed to be devised.  

The new nose design had two components.
The inner component would be secured to the fuselage at all times, and the front part would be removeable.
The inner part would be secured to the boom using a clamping mechanism, originally devised for the landing gear, via three M3 bolts located underneath the boom.
The outer part would then twist into the inner part then be locked in place using two M3 bolts.

\end{figure} 

% \importimage{nose-inner-section}{inner section of the nose.}{Nose inner section}{0.7}

The inner part would have a 1mm wall thickness, supported by 5mm deep and 3mm wide support structures, this is common on 3D printed UAV components as it is a light way of adding strength.
The clamping system is supported by a web like structure.
The battery tray and ESC compartment had a small redesign, two larger vents channelling airflow to the ESC.
The steerable landing gear has also been incorporated into the design, through the air vents. 

% \importimage{nose-outer-section}{outer section of the nose.}{Nose outer section}{0.7}

The outer section will be held in place via a twist and lock system.
To remove the front section two screws will be removed from the side of the nose, the front will then twist anticlockwise and be removed.
Once removed, the electronics inside will be removed easily over the battery tray.
The motor can easily be removed via 4 screws located towards the front of the nose and replaced by a 3D printed part for when not in use.
The motor mount area has also been lightened, will similar structural supports on the 1mm outer wall applied. 

\importimage{outer-nose-fea}{FEA on the outer nose join.}{Nose join FEA}{0.7}

FEA was carried out on the outer section to ensure it was strong enough to support the fuselage.
Figure 13 shows a 140N force applied to the locking tabs.
For SLS Nylon the yield strength was set at 60Mpa.
However, with the 140N load applied, the maximum stress reached was 5.582MPa, and a maximum displacement of 0.1mm. 

Having fulfilled the first three criteria, the final design also incorporates a steerable landing gear.
This part of the design was thought about throughout the design process, but only fully implemented after the landing gear design had been finalised. 

% \importimage{steerable-gear}{integration of the steerable nose gear.}{Steerable nose gear}{0.7}

Figure 16 shows how the nose gear would have been incorporated within the vent design.
The nose gear would be secured using two collars, one above and below the thicker part of the nose, as well as one to secure the servo arm in place.
The servo arm would be attached to the servo via two springs, these will reduce the impacts and prevent the nose from rapid direction changes due to bumps.
The servo will be bolted onto the battery tray, to one side, to allow space for the battery tray to be removed. 

As stated during the landing gear analysis, depending on the configuration, will have to withstand a force of up to around 35N on landing.
Therefore, FEA was carried out on the nose.
The results show a moderate level of stress on the wall at the bottom of the vent; however, this was about half of the perceived yield strength of the SLS nylon which would be used. 

\importimage{nose-connection-fea}{FEA on nose and landing gear connection.}{Nose connection FEA}{0.7}

When the nose motor was not needed it was removed and replaced with a small insert.
The hollow insert would have been 3D printed on the university 3D printer using PLA as it is not a structural component.
It was designed to be screwed in the same manner as the motor.

\section{Tail} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:tail}

\subsection{Mathematical modelling} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:tail:mathematical-modelling}

The tail needs to provide adequate stability to the aircraft in all stages of flight, as well as house the elevator and rudder control surfaces.
Design for the tail and stability systems essentially re-started following research and dialogue with our supervisor after the wing tunnel test, which revealed the true scope of the design process required. 

Design began with the tail surfaces themselves.
As the centre of gravity of the aircraft would not be in line with the centre of lift, the tailplane would need an angle of attack that would facilitate the aircrafts stability throughout flight, with minimal to no trim from the elevators.
The sizing of the tail surfaces, and their angles were again determined using processes from (Sadraey, 2013).
In particular an example of tail design was followed from section 6.1 (and slightly modified) to obtain the tail dimensions and setting angle. 

The process began similarly as that of the wind tunnel model.
Revised volume coefficients were suggested as 0.8 for the horizontal tail, and 0.06 for the vertical tail (Towell, 2019).
Equations [1] and [2], were used to determine the tail planform area as 0.16 m2 for the horizontal tail, and 0.08 m2 for the vertical tail.  

Next the cruise lift coefficient was determined, using equation 6.27 from (Sadraey, 2013) and was found to be 0.4671, based on a weight of 7g (68.67 N), cruise speed of 20 m s-1 and wing planform area of 0.6 m2.
Next the wing/fuselage aerodynamic pitching moment coefficient required estimating.
Sadraey’s book provided an equation for this, however at the suggestion of Prof. Towell, equation E-40, which determined the change in wing pitching moment due to the fuselage, from E. Torenbeek’s book, ‘Synthesis of Subsonic Airplane Design’ (Torenbeek, 1976).
This was determined to be -0.0398.
Based on a chart from ‘Airfoil Tools’ for the NACA 6412 aerofoil, the wing 0 lift pitching moment coefficient was determined to be -0.137 (Airfoil Tools, 2020).
Then, this and the fuselage offset were summed to give a value of the wing/fuselage pitch moment coefficient of -0.1768. 

The next stage of the process required values for the centre of lift and mass locations in terms of percent of the MAC of the wing.
As these were unknown at this stage, they were estimated to be h = 0.25 (quarter chord) for the centre of lift (a reasonable assumption for most wings) and h0 = 0.5 (half chord) for the centre of mass, which was a worst case value. 

Next, the required lift coefficient of the horizontal tailplane was required.
Essentially, the moment caused by the lift, thrust and weight, as well as the wing pitching moment has to be counteracted by a moment provided by the tail.
It was decided that this should be negated at the cruise speed of the UAV, reducing the work required by the pilot for the bulk of the flight.
The tail uses a symmetrical aerofoil, and as such provides no lift force at 0 incidence, so requires a mounting angle to provide a balancing moment.
However, this has to take into account changes to flow incidence caused by the fuselage angle of attack at cruise to make the wing provide sufficient weight balancing lift, as well as flow downwash caused by the wing. 

To calculate the tail cruise lift coefficient, (Sadraey, 2013) provided equation 6.29, however Prof. Towell suggested a method which rearranged a substituted force and moment balance of the aircraft in cruise, which resulted in an equation for the angle of attack of the fuselage relative to the wing zero lift line: 

\importequation{
    \alpha_{F_{0L}} = \frac{
        \frac{2mg}{V^2} + \frac{C_{m0}c}{l}
    }{
        \rho S C_{L\alpha} (1 + \frac{h-h_0}{l})
    }
}{tail-cruise-lift-coefficient}

At 20 m s-1, the fuselage angle was determined to be 0.0944 radians (relative to wing zero lift).
The tail cruise lift coefficient could then be determined using a modified version of equation 6.29 from (Sadraey, 2013) as -0.0871.
Using an equation for the lift coefficient $C_L = C_{L\alpha}\alpha$, the required incidence of the tail could then be determined as -1.238o.
The fuselage angle of attack had been determined relative to the wing 0 lift line previously.
The wing 0 lift line is 5.7o, and the wing is mounted at 2o, giving the wing zero lift line as 7.7 o relative to the fuselage datum.
This gives the fuselage angle of attack in flight as -2.294o.  

The wing downwash calculation requires the downwash at 0 angle of attack, and the downwash curve slope.
These were both determined using equation E-52 in (Torenbeek, 1976): Calculating these values and substituting into the equation for downwash gave a value for the downwash caused by the wing, at the tail as 1.924o.
Finally, the tail setting angle could be calculated , which resulted as a setting angle relative to the fuselage datum of 2.979o.

\end{figure} 

One verification was to calculate the pitch stability derivative, using equation 6.67 in (Sadraey, 2013), which resulted as -0.6301.
A negative value indicates that the pitch moment decreases with alpha, which is desirable.
Following a process from Aerospace course year 2 notes from Mechanics of Flight gave a stick fixed static margin of 0.1574, and a stick fixed manoeuvre margin of 0.2747, both of which are acceptable values (De-Kat, 2017). 

Work on the yaw control requirements of the aircraft led to the decision to have an upper and lower vertical stabiliser, since extra rudder area was required, and to act as a bumper so that that in tail pusher propeller configuration, where take off rotation or a hard landing might lead to tail propeller contacting the ground, the propeller and therefore the aircraft would be protected.
It was considered to mount a wheel on this bumper when thought to use a tail wheel configuration, however the team eventually settled on a nose wheel configuration, so the bumper remained (visible in figure 49 above). 

Tail spars were resized using the same process as the wind tunnel model, as it had been decided to switch to pultruded carbon fibre rather than aluminium to save weight and move the centre of gravity forward.
The process does not account for the bonding of the extra foam material to the spars, so the estimated deflection will likely be pessimistic.  

Basic calculations from Year 3 Aircraft Structural Design module (Bresloff, 2018) were made to assess the potential effect of gusts and manoeuvres on tail loading.
It was estimated that the maximum load likely to be seen in a gust encounter at the predicted flight altitude was approximately 39 N.
The maximum expected load from a manoeuvre was approximately 14 N, both within the 10g limit load designed for. 

\subsection{CAD modelling} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:tail:cad-modelling}

The tail surface CAD was generated as a lofted base using aerofoil profiles of a NACA0012 with a scaling factor applied to make a NACA0018, lining up at the trailing edge.
The root was shortened to allow for the tail mount geometry, and cut-outs added for the tail spars, control surfaces and hot wire routes.
Initially the control surfaces were to be pinned into place with a laser cut sheet bonded to the end of the lifting surface holding a pin extending into control surface for it to rotate around, however in order to facilitate disassembly of the tail sub-assembly, this was changed into a 3D printed component that would neatly hold a nut on the end of a threaded rod bonded to the end of the tail spar.

The tail surfaces were designed to be inserted into 3D printed component as it was realised that the tail would require a lot of functionality that would be hard to facilitate with a foam or set of laser cut parts.
This was decided to be a piece that would split in half vertically, allowing the vertical surfaces to be inserted easily, and the horizontal surfaces would require a small amount of trimming to allow them to slide in over the spars, and then secured using bolts.
The CAD process for the final version of the tail mount can be seen below:

\end{figure} 

The process began with a tapered section hollowed out to 1.5 mm wall thickness, and a rectangular tube added for the tail spar.
The inside and outside corners were filleted. 

Next ribs were added for lightweight structural support, made by a complex series of combined bodies.  

Supporting structure was added from the outside walls to meet the spar tube in the centre.
A mounting location was added for the tail motor, and channels to run securing bolts through added, as it was planned to make the part in two halves to aid assembly.  

In an assembly, the tail lifting surfaces were added, and moved to the correct position using mates, and then their bodies subtracted from the mount body. 

Servo mounts were added and a motor mounting solution added based on a teammates previous design, and then a shroud was added over the motor, as well as a wire route for the motor connections.
The structure was eventually split in half and holes for spars added, and the model tidied up for 3D printing. 

A small structure was added to the front to allow for mounting to the foam ahead of it 

Finally a small 3D printed part was designed to fit into the attachment location at the rear of the tail mount.
This was based on Michael Pywell’s design earlier on in the project, and simply had a cylinder with wide radial teeth protruding from the inside.
The motor mount had the same teeth, and would slide axially in the cylinder through the gaps, and then rotate, the teeth overlapping to prevent the mount from moving.
Small holes cut through both parts of the mount allowed for threaded inserts to be placed inside, and then screws through the same holes would secure the mount in place.

\section{Control surfaces} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:control-surfaces}

\subsection{Mathematical modelling} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:control-surfaces:mathematical-modelling}

The control surfaces were designed around their ability to meet several criteria that commercial aircraft must satisfy to be flyable. While this UAV isn’t required to meet the same stringent safety standards, many are there simply to ensure the aircraft flies properly, so it was prudent to meet them, a such, the rudder was designed to maintain trim control in the unlikely event of a wing tip motor failing resulting in worst case asymmetric thrust.  

To begin, the rudder was parameterised in terms of the ratio of it’s chord to the root chord of the vertical stabiliser, it’s span, and it’s inside offset from the root of the stabiliser allowing space for the servo.
Several useful parameters were derived from this including the MAC ratio, which was used on a plot from (Sadraey, 2013) to find the angle of attack effectiveness ($tau$) of the rudder, which was used to calculate the rudder control derivative using equation 12.100 in (Sadraey, 2013).
The rudder was modelled to be functioning at the predicted stall speed of the aircraft as it would be expected to maintain control at this speed.
A maximum deflection of 30 degrees was selected based (Sadraey, 2013), then this and relevant values substituted into equation 12.104a in (Sadraey, 2013) to calculate the vertical stabiliser lift with a deflected rudder. 

The first version of this with only the upper vertical stabiliser yielded a lift of 5.08 N.
This required comparing to the moment from the tip motor at full thrust, at stall speed.
The thrust of the motor changes with the inflow velocity.
Analysis of motor test data gave the thrust at predicted stall speed to be 8.73 N.
The wing has a semi-span of 1 m, so this is equal to the moment theoretically created in an asymmetric thrust scenario at this speed.
The tail arm was initially to be 1 m, but was reduced to 0.9 m for the purpose of moving the centre of mass forward, giving a tail moment of 4.57 Nm, which is approximately half of that required by the asymmetric thrust scenario.
This design flaw, combined with the fact that the rear propeller in that configuration would be unprotected on rotation or a hard landing, led to the decision to add a lower vertical stabiliser, despite it being surplus required vertical stabiliser area. 

The upper stabiliser was extended very slightly, the same root and tip chords maintained for upper and lower stabilisers, and simply a span extended below the fuselage until it extended approximately an inch beyond the lowest reach of the rear propeller, visible in figure 53. 

The values of both spans were altered until the force created by the deflected rudder was sufficient to counteract the moment from the asymmetric thrust.
The increase of the span had the effect of increasing the effective aspect ratio of the vertical stabiliser, which increased the efficiency, and thus the 3D lift curve slope, so it wasn’t required to simply double the area. 

The calculation was run with different speed values in Excel, to plot the rudder effectiveness and the motor thrust moment, over the expected speed range of the UAV: 

\importimage{rudder-thrust-moment}{rudder against thrust moment at various speeds.}{Rudder against thrust moment}{0.95}

With this requirement satisfied, design of the rudder was concluded.
The lack of runway landing and already excessive rudder size lead to the decision to forgo other rudder validation tests. 

The next stage of the design was the elevators, which began with parameterized geometry of the elevator through a root chord ratio.
A value of a quarter chord was selected initially, and this proved to be more than sufficient for all subsequent analyses, so remained.
The elevators took up all available trailing edge span of the horizontal stabiliser, leaving only room for the servo required to control it.  

The first attempt at the analysis of required deflections implemented a MATLAB code from (Sadraey, 2013) section 12.8.2, in Excel, to plot out the elevator deflections for the most fore and aft centre of gravity, and over the predicted speed range of the UAV.
The output of this code appeared to not be able to capture the 0 elevator deflection required at cruise speed (as the tail mounting angle has been designed around this).
Prof. Towell provided another method to try before assuming that the tail mounting angle calculations were wrong.  

The process given started with a moment balance about the centre of gravity of the aircraft including lift, tail lift, wing pitch moment equated to the tail lift moment.
This could have values substituted in for lift, and be rearranged for the tail lift coefficient: 

\importequation{
    C_{L_h} = \frac{q S C_L (h-h_0) c + T z_T + q S C_{M_0}}{q S_h l}
}{cog-moment-balance}

Then performing analysis of forces in vertical equilibrium, rearranging and substituting for the tail lift coefficient above  and rearranging for alpha, yielded the fuselage angle of attack at a given cruise condition: 

\importequation{
    \alpha = \frac{2 (mgl - Tz_T) V^{-2} - c C_{M_0}}{\rho S C_{L_\alpha}(l + (h - h_0)c)}
}{vertical-equilibrium}

With alpha found for a range of speeds, it could be used to find the tail lift coefficient for that particular speed, which is found by a rearranged version of the equation for tail lift coefficient, noting $\frac{S_h l}{Sc} = \overline{V}_h$, yielding: 

\importequation{
    C_{L_h} = \frac{C_{L_\alpha}\alpha(h-h_0) + \frac{Tz_T}{qSc} + C_{M_0}}{\overline{V}_h}
}{rearranged-tail-lift-coefficient}

With this, the elevator deflection can finally be calculated using:

\importequation{
    \delta = \frac{C_{L_h}}{C_{L_{\alpha_h}}} - \alpha (1 - \epsilon_\alpha) - \epsilon_0 - \frac{\alpha_h}{\tau_e}
}{elevator-deflection}

The process used above, along with the failed MATLAB code, repeated for a range of speeds yielded this plot (see legend for details):

\importimage{elevator-deflection}{elevator deflection plots for both processes.}{Elevator deflection plots}{0.95}

The second process captured the 0 deflection required at cruise speed, and appeared to be correct, so design was concluded as satisfactory in this case.
Additionally the deflections required from below the stall (and take off) speed are within the maximum deflections of the elevator selected.
The last test for the elevator was that it was satisfactory for aircraft rotation performance, which was based on a process from section 12.8.2 in (Sadraey, 2013), and involved determining all forces and moments on the aircraft for the elevator to overcome on aircraft rotation.
To begin, the take-off induced drag factor was determined using equation 5.22 in (Sadraey, 2013), then this and other pre-determined values were used to determine the take-off drag coefficient using equation 5.68 from (Sadraey, 2013).
This was then used to determine the take-off drag using the basic drag equation at a take-off speed of 13 m s-1 and a value of 11.56 N was calculated.  

Next the pitching moment about the aerodynamic centre was estimated as the wing 0 lift pitch moment coefficient, and then a basic pitch moment equation to determine the moment on take-off as -2.55 Nm.
The aircraft’s linear acceleration on rotation was then determined using equation 12.55 from (Sadraey, 2013) with an estimated friction coefficient of grass from Table 9.7 in (Sadraey, 2013). 

Next, several geometric parameters of the aircraft were determined from the CAD model to be then substituted into equation 12.72 in (Sadraey, 2013) to determine the lift required of the tail to achieve a set angular acceleration given the aircraft’s mass moment inertia about the pitch axis.
This yielded a tail lift of -3.17 N, which gave a tail lift coefficient of -0.192.
Checking using the method defined previously to determine the elevator deflections at various speeds gave+ a required deflection of -7.59o, which is less than the maximum of -25o, so this is acceptable.
This concluded elevator design. 

Finally, the ailerons required sizing.
This was based around their ability to reach a required roll angle within a set time.
This requirement varies based on the aircraft type and flight phase, which was determined from table 12.12b in (Sadraey, 2013) as a class II at phase C, at level 1.
The ailerons were parameterized by chord ratio (beginning with a value of 0.25, which proved satisfactory, so remained), and their inboard and outboard spans, however these were limited by the motor mount locations, so the main value to iterate upon was the chord ratio.  

A process from section 12.8.1 of (Sadraey, 2013) was used to determine aileron performance, beginning with the determination of the angle of attack effectiveness of the ailerons using the same method as previously.
This and several parameters were used in equation 12.23 from (Sadraey, 2013) to determine the aileron rolling moment coefficient derivative, yielding a value of 0.273 rad s-1, which was then used to determine the aileron rolling moment coefficient at the maximum deflection of the aileron using equation 12.13 in (Sadraey, 2013), which gave a value of 0.095. 

The ailerons need to be effective at an estimated approach velocity of 1.1 times the stall speed.
The aileron lift was then determined using equation 12.11 in (Sadraey, 2013) which resulted as 10.04 N.
This was then used to determine the steady state roll rate using equation 12.37 in (Sadraey, 2013), which gave a value of 7.14 rad s-1, which was then used to determine the bank angle at which the steady state roll rate would be achieved, using equation 12.43 in (Sadraey, 2013), which gave a value of 74.57 degrees.
The rate of roll rate could then be calculated using equation 12.49 in (Sadraey, 2013), which gave a value of 0.342 rad s-2.
Finally, the time to reach a bank angle of 30 degrees could be calculated using equation 12.47 in (Sadraey, 2013), which resulted as 1.75 seconds, less than the maximum 1.8 seconds, so the aircraft satisfied roll control requirements.
The time reduced to 1.17 seconds for the same process repeated at cruise speed. 

To conclude control surface mathematical design, it was checked using XFOIL that the servos chosen would be able to cope with the hinge moments.
For aesthetics it was chosen to have the servo axis in line with the control surface axis.
This removes the need for horn controls.
A code was used that yielded a hinge moment coefficient, which was then multiplied by relevant values to obtain the hinge moment.
As the servo and control surface axes were in line, if this value was greater than the stall torque of the servo, the servo was deemed inappropriate.
The SG90S had been selected, and was appropriate for all control surfaces, apart from the upper rudder, which was later changed to a HITEC HS 85 MG servo, which had sufficient stall torque.

The rudder basic shape was cut out from a duplicate of the vertical stabiliser model.
The space for the servo was cut out from the root, then additional cut-outs made for the stiffening spar near the leading edge, and foam cutter wire paths.
Next a thin second body was extruded from the root to define a laser cut profile that would allow for the servo arm to have a place to nest into, allowing for control of the rudder.
Lastly a small circular profile (designed to be cut off manually later) was extruded on the trailing edge so that the foam cutter would not damage the trailing edge since it was so thin.
The secondary rudder and elevators were defined identically. 

The ailerons were generated from a sketch of the aerofoil profile which was defined from the wing profile sketch, then one aileron extruded in a long profile, then, planes were defined in the model that referenced the motor mount surfaces in contact with the aileron root and tip surfaces.
Material outside of these two planes was then removed to define one aileron, which was then mirrored about the centre plane, defining both ailerons in a way that would instantly react to changes in motor mount location and spans between them.
Next a small amount was cut off the roots of the ailerons and replaced with a small laser cut profile extruded outwards, similarly to the tail control surfaces that allowed for the inline servo arm to control the aileron.
Finally, holes were added for a stiffening spar, and wire paths added for the foam cutter. 

\section{Electronics} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:electronics}

% TODO: split into subsubsections

The avionics of the aircraft were meant to fulfil two main goals.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide the pilot with assistance in flying the aircraft using a flight controller, generally maintaining stability. 
    \item Have basic autopilot functionality, allowing the aircraft to fly in straight and level flight at a consistent speed to enable the fair testing of different flight configurations. 
\end{itemize}

As well as this, the avionics would be required to extend and retract the flaps, and ideally to record data - specifically on the rate of battery drainage. 

The primary role of the flight controller is to convert control inputs from the pilot into control inputs that are sent directly to the servos, and is normally accomplished through a range of techniques, including PID controllers.
Two main flight controllers were investigated, the first being a Pixhawk flight controller - more expensive, but potentially more useful and had been used by people at the university before - and the second being a Matek F405-Wing board with iNav Flight firmware installed on it. 

While the Pixhawk could have been easier to set up, with its advertised “plug and play” functionality, it was significantly more expensive, and it was decided that looking into the Matek controller could be worth a potentially large saving, albeit with a greater risk of purchasing the controller to find that it did not work as expected.
The Matek hardware came at about half the cost, and while the corresponding firmware was relatively immature, its open source nature meant that its functionality was expanding quickly, and it had favourable reviews from a number of online sources.
Another potential advantage of the Matek controller was that it was designed specifically with fixed wing aircraft in mind, whereas the Pixhawk was focused more towards quadcopters. 

\importimage{matek}{pin layout and documentation for the Matek flight controller.}{Flight controller layout}{0.95}  % TODO: include source (http://www.mateksys.com/?portfolio=f405-wing)

Other beneficial features of the Matek board were the built-in current sensor and inertial measurement unit (IMU) which would provide estimates of the position, and more importantly orientation, of the UAV.
There were also a number of fairly low-cost GPS and airspeed sensor units, required for the latter part of the avionics system’s brief of providing autopilot functionality. 

\importimage{flight-configurator}{flight configurator software used to set up the flight controller.}{Flight configurator}{0.6}

Input to the flight controller could be achieved through a number of systems, most notably through SBUS; this type of serial connection appeared to be the most commonly supported amongst receivers, and would allow up to sixteen channels to be passed from the receiver to the controller.
The minimum required channels would be eight: four for throttle, yaw, pitch, and roll; two for flaps (on/off); and similarly two for the autopilot toggle.
With the additional channels it would in principle be feasible to implement extra features, such as manually cutting off outboard motors in the event that one of them should fail. 

Also of interest were the UART ports, which is a serial communication protocol broadly compatible with a number of microcontrollers, including Arduinos.
This would be a good option for extracting the data from the current sensor and passing it to a microcontroller - most likely an Arduino Nano - which could then integrate the current draw over time to provide an estimate of the battery capacity used by a particular configuration.
Being able to do this onboard was appealing because the need for telemetry, which would have significantly increased the complexity of the radio system, could be removed.
All data could be logged by a relatively simple program, written in C++, which could then be downloaded after each flight. 

\importimage{flight-controller-computer}{flight controller plugged into a computer running the flight configurator.}{Flight controller configuration}{0.6}
\importimage{flight-controller-receiver}{receiver undergoing the binding procedure.}{Receiver binding}{0.5}

While a Futaba transmitter was originally to be loaned from the university, scheduling constraints resulted in its unavailability for the duration of the project.
As an alternative, a FrSky Taranis X9D was purchased upon recommendation of its being a good tradeoff between price and flexibility.
The model is widely used and compatible with a wide range of receivers, uses a standard communication protocol, and also runs a configurable operating system, OpenTx, which enables it to be programmed in Lua.
As well as the standard joysticks, the handset has triggers and switches which can be mapped to the flaps and autopilot channels. 

Two primary factors constrained the selection of receiver.
The first was the output method, which needed to be SBUS to be compatible with the Matek flight controller, and have at least eight output channels.
The second was compatibility with the Taranis transmitter, which ruled out a number of Futaba receivers operating on a proprietary communication protocol. 

Other factors, while less important, included the power usage, cost, and size of the receiver.
The receiver was intended to fit onto an electronics tray along with the flight controller, and would be powered by the same battery as the flight controller, microcontroller, and servos.
A receiver, the FrSky X8R, was found, operating on 100mA at 5V (the standardised output voltage of the flight controller), and weighing less than 20g.
Its profile is also similar to that of the flight controller, meaning that it would not be the limiting factor in the size and shape of the electronics tray when the fuselage was designed. 

When bound to a Taranis X9D, the X8R is capable of receiving sixteen independent channels via FrSky’s radio transfer protocol ACCESS (a newer and more robust version of ACCST).
This would be more than sufficient for the eight channels required as a baseline for the project, and would also leave room for the expansion of the project with additional features, as mentioned previously, with the eight leftover channels.
The operating range of 1.5km would also be more than sufficient for the project. 

As well as being compatible with the Taranis transmitter and capable of outputting to SBUS, the receiver had a number of serial ports (standard PWM outputs) which could be used for testing and validating its functionality without having to pass the signals through the flight controller first.
It was thought that this could be useful in the later stages of the project while troubleshooting any issues, being able to remove the flight controller from the loop and isolate the receiver to check that it was communicating properly with the transmitter. 

All moveable surfaces on the aircraft are actuated by servos.
These are split into four groups: ailerons, elevators, rudder, and flaps.
The first three are the control surfaces by which the aircraft is controlled, and would need to be sized for a fairly limited selection of manoeuvres.
It was not expected that the aircraft would be performing any tight turns, but the load that would be transferred through the aileron servos could depend greatly on the configuration of the propulsion modules.
With the modules located at the end of the wings, the greatly increased moment of inertia of the aircraft would mean that actuating the ailerons would not produce nearly as much inertial relief as when the motors and batteries were located on the centreline.
As such, the servos could be expected to see a fairly variable range of loads.
In addition, the loads experienced by the rudder servos was found to be far in excess of the loads experienced by all other servos when the possibility of an asymmetric motor failure at the wingtips was considered.
It was decided that these servos would need to be of a different type to those elsewhere in the aircraft. 

In all, fourteen servos would be required to control the aircraft, including the two servos of different specification for the rudder.
The exact configuration of these servos, as well as the signals passed to each of them, is shown below. 

\importimage{signal-splitters}{control signal splitter schematic.}{Signal splitter schematic}{0.7}

Note that each flap is supported by two servos of opposing deflection directions.
While the flaps increase the lift of the aircraft quite dramatically, and thereby exert a large moment onto their supporting servos, the distribution of this load across four flap segments and eight servos meant that the smaller servo size was capable of holding the flaps in place during takeoff and landing. 

One potential issue with the servos selected was the degradation of the plastic-toothed gears they use.
Information from peers suggested that sufficient use would wear the gears down and reduce their effective strength, causing the gears to slide at a smaller load than suggested by the servos’ data sheets.
An experiment was devised to repetitively test a servo under load (actuating it far more times than would ever be expected of a servo in a flight model) to see whether its strength afterwards was the same as upon its delivery; but this experiment was never carried out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the event that it had been found to significantly impact the strength of the servos, metal-toothed servos could have been purchased at a slightly higher cost. 

The entirety of the electronics subsystem was to be powered by a single battery, referred to as the avionics battery.
This would be connected to the flight controller, powering it directly, and indirectly powering the receiver, microcontroller, and servos.
While throttle signals would be supplied to the motors from the flight controller directly, the bulk of their power would come from the ESCs, which are in turn powered by the battery local to that propulsion module. 

In order to size the battery used for the avionics, the approximate power draw of each of the electrical components needed to be determined.
Research was conducted, considering the following items drawing power during a typical 10-minute flight: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Servos
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Draw 10mA while idle, 100-250mA while moving, and have a stall current of 360mA 
            \item The stall torque of the servos being used is 1.7kg.cm, meaning that for a 4cm control surface, a load of roughly 0.5kg would need to be applied to cause a stall.
                Considering that there are nine control surfaces and that the total lift generated by the aircraft is around 7kg, it can reasonably be assumed that the likelihood of any individual control surface experiencing a load of 0.5kg is extremely small; certainly small enough that it will occur only momentarily and does not need to be factored into the draw calculations 
            \item 8 servos are being used for the flaps and so will only move for a few seconds per flight 
            \item One servo connected to the nose gear, which will likely only be moving periodically within two 30-second windows at the start and end of each flight 
            \item 5 servos are connected to the control surfaces.
                It is assumed that control surfaces will only move for around 50\% of the time while in the air.
                To build in a bit of redundancy and account for the movement of the flap/gear servos, it is assumed that the power drain from servos will be equivalent to five servos moving constantly 
            \item This then means 1000mA drawn by servos 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Receiver: listed as drawing a continuous 100mA 
    \item Flight controller: listed as drawing a continuous 500mA, a conservative estimate 
    \item The exact current draw of a microcontroller is difficult to determine as it depends primarily on how much the processor is being used.
        Even conservative estimates resulted in around 20mA of draw, so that was neglected here as it is so much smaller than the other components 
\end{itemize}

An additional constraint placed on the battery was the required voltage of between 9 and 30 volts.  As the battery needs to be a LiPo battery, this limited the selection to those with between 3 and 6 cells. 

Given a total of 1600mA drawn while in flight (a conservative estimate which also accounts for the small amount of additional power used for one-off events during takeoff and landing), and the voltage requirements, a few batteries were found which could power the avionics.
Several higher-capacity batteries were heavier and more expensive and, while they would enable multiple flights on one battery, switching out multiple lower-capacity batteries which were both lighter and cheaper was found to be more cost- and mass-effective, and also in keeping with the modular nature of the project. 

The battery settled on was therefore a 450mA, 11.1V, and 65-130C discharge, which should provide for at least 15 minutes of flight on a conservative estimate of the power draw.
Its low cost means that multiple can be bought and swapped out between flights, while used batteries are recharged. 

With all the components of the avionics subsystem specified, a wiring diagram could be created and from this an iron bird constructed.
The primary goal of this exercise was to check that every required component was present, and that they would all fit together with the necessary wires. 

\importimage{wiring-diagram}{wiring diagram for the avionics subsystem.}{Wiring diagram}{0.6}

From the above diagram, the iron bird was built onto a miniaturised cutout of the same general shape as the full-size aircraft. 

\importimage{iron-bird}{iron bird.}{Iron bird}{0.7}

While not all of the servos were included in the iron bird, each servo group was represented.
The iron bird also gave a much clearer indication of roughly how much wiring would be needed to connect the various groups, and which layout would be most efficient for splitting the signals; that is, which signals should be brought down each of the main “limbs” of the aircraft, and where should they be split.
Once this was decided, the splitters could be designed and manufactured. 

\importimage{splitter-schematic}{manufacturing schematic for a single splitter.}{Manufacturing schematic}{0.5}

A schematic similar to the one shown above was drawn out for each of the splitters identified in Figure \ref{fig:splitter-schematic}.
This includes the specification of the splitter in terms of the signals designated as inputs and outputs, and shows its layout in terms of header pins (rectangular boxes) soldered (ovals) across a stripboard whose strips are assumed to go across the page horizontally.
Breaks in the stripboard are shown here by small vertical lines instead of a dot representing the corresponding hole. 

These splitters were manufactured from small cut segments of stripboard by simply soldering header pins in the correct locations.
The seven splitters also had small outcrops of stripboard so that they could be fastened to relevant locations throughout the body of the aircraft. 

\importimage{manufactured-splitters}{each of the manufactured splitters.}{Manufactured splitters}{0.8}

Although the full electronics system was never assembled in the UAV due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the necessary physical components were purchased and manufactured, and their compatibility was tested in the iron bird.

Before the electronics were to be flown on the UAV, they needed to be tested.
There was thorough testing of the electronics out of any aircraft first, but in order to be deemed flight worthy it needed to be tested in the air in a sacrificial flight vehicle.
The foamy selection was based on the constraints of the fuselage size required in order to have room to fit all of the electronics inside, keeping the cost as low as possible, and having an aircraft that we could fly ourselves (easy to fly for beginners).
The fuselage needed to be able to fit all of the necessity electronics; battery, ESC, receiver, as well as our additional electronics to control the autopilot; Arduino, Matek, and GPS.
Therefore we needed a beginners plane that had excess fuselage space, and so we chose the Bixler 3 as it has a large internal space for the necessity electronics, as well as an empty nose for installation of a camera for FPV flying, and this space would be suitable for fitting in our additional electronics.
Additionally the plane is designed for beginners and so has a large surface area wing for low speed flying, high mounted for flight stability, the motor and propeller face rearwards above the fuselage to get them out of the way of damage in the event of a crash, and the underside of the fuselage is strengthened to act as a skid if the landing gear comes off in a particularly heavy landing.
All of this makes it ideal for our use case.
However, it was not flow due to the coronavirus lockdown, and so the electronics could not be flight tested. 

\section{Avionics and software} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:avionics-and-software}

% TODO: populate from electronics section

\section{Propulsion} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:propulsion}

The design of the housing for the motors and its subsidiary systems focused on permitting the repositioning of these system in a small time window without the need for alteration to the design.
Thus increasing the amount of flights which can be completed in one day.
This was crucial so that the difference in atmospheric conditions are reduced to minimum. 
A self-contained housing storing the motor, the ESC and the battery was designed; referred as ‘Power Unit Cell’ (PUC).
The use of such design allowed the reduction of wires running through the wing as well as making those components more accessible for maintenance.
Furthermore, the use of a compact design allowed for a standard PUC which could be used in all wing propulsion configurations.
This was achieved by creating a standard simple profile for the surfaces normal to the attachment points; this is evident in Fig. 12.
In order to guarantee a smooth passage of the flow around the housing an adapter is created for each configuration.
This slots onto the standardized surfaces of the power unit cell and mounts directly on the wing surfaces blending the two together.
Furthermore, they ensure that the thrust line in unvaried between tractor and pusher configurations.

The distance from the trailing edge to the propeller in the pusher layout is equivalent to the distance from the leading edge to the propeller in the tractor layout.
Moreover, as in can be seen in Fig. 12.
The attachment holes for the mounting bolts remain in the same position despite the change in arrangement.
Hence, allowing to interchange propulsion layouts without the need of modifications to the components. 
The power unit cells are as well split in two components: a front section and a rear section.
Thus permitting to access the components stored inside with the removal of the four M4 bolts securing the two halves together.
Four threaded inserts imbedded in the nylon structure of the front section allow the fitting of the motor.
The battery and the ESC are instead slotted into the rear section of the cell.
The open section into which the ESC is placed ensures the cooling of this component in all configurations setup.
So to avoid common reliability issues caused by the overheating of this last.
An exploded view of the PUC assembly is shown in Fig. 13. 

% \importimage{puc-exploded}{exploded view of the PUC assembly.}{Exploded PUC}{0.6}

Due to the fitting of the battery and the ESC, the PUC assembly has a sensible weight.
In fact, as it will be discussed, the CG of the UAV is subject to a significant shift as the motor configuration is changed from tractor to pusher.
A reduction in this effect leads to a less significant need to rely on a ballast to maintain the CG in the same location. 
In order to reduce this effect, the battery was located in a closer position to half chord length with some compromises made for the aerodynamic aspect.
Furthermore, a work of light weighting of the components was carried.
Hence the use of ribs and reinforcements where loads concentrate and the use of thin walls shown in Fig. 14.
This resulted into an overall housing dry weight of 207g.
