\newchapter{Final Design Proposal}{final-design-proposal}

\section{Wing} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing}

The wing assembly was designed to be unfastened from the fuselage assembly with ease.
Such a decision was established so as to reduce the encumbrance of the UAV during transportation.
The wing assembly is comprised of two carbon spars placed respectively at quarter and half chord, and extending for the entire \metres{2} wingspan, each half of the wing containing three ribs (Figure \ref{fig:ribs}).
These ribs fulfil multiple functions in the wing assembly and will be discussed in further detail later.
The use of profiles carved out of blue styrofoam (extruded polystyrene) provide a lightweight structure for the aerodynamic profiles such as flaps, aileron, and wing itself.
A hollow profile also allows the fitting of wires in the wing structure.
A central mounting plate provides the fitting points for the fastening of the wing assembly to the fuselage.

\subsection{Spars} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:spars}

The two-spar structure utilised for the wind tunnel model's wing exhibited only small deflections in bending and twist when tested, and this same configuration is therefore maintained for the flight model.
Two carbon spars are used for the final design, thus reducing the weight while maintaining the same structural characteristics.
These were sized for a loading case equal to $4g$, at which the wing would present a deflection of \mm{54} at the wing tip as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:fea-half-wingspan}.
Both spars have a wall thickness of \mm{2} whereas their diameters differ: the first one, positioned at quarter chord, has a diameter of \mm{16}; while the one positioned at half chord has a diameter of \mm{14}.

\importimage{fea-half-wingspan}{FEA of half wingspan subject to a distributed load of 138N/m.}{FEA of half wingspan}{0.9}

\subsection{Ribs} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:ribs}

The attachment points for the power units take the form of 3D printed inserts embedded in the wing structure.
These, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:ribs}, present the same aerofoil section as the wing so as not to disrupt the airflow.
Three inserts per half wingspan allow as many different propulsion positions as possible: \pc{20} wingspan, \pc{40} wingspan, and \pc{100} wingspan (wingtip); thus allowing the assessment of the effects of the propulsion unit placed close to the fuselage structure (\pc{20} wingspan); at the optimal position found by Kroo (\cite{kroo-86}), \pc{40} wingspan; and at the wingtip (\pc{100} wingspan).

The design of this last is mounting point is, however, different from the semi-span inserts.
For each of the semi-span inserts, the same motor unit can be mounted in four different configurations: underwing pusher, underwing tractor, overwing pusher, and overwing tractor (Figures \ref{fig:wing-mounting:underwing-pusher} through \ref{fig:wing-mounting:overwing-tractor} respectively); while for the wingtip-mounted element the number of available configurations is two: pusher and tractor (Figures \ref{fig:wing-mounting:wingtip-pusher} and \ref{fig:wing-mounting:wingtip-tractor}).
Adaptors are adopted to blend the standardised connection surface of the motor housing with the wing's surface, thus reducing the aerodynamic footprint.

\end{figure}

Each semi-span insert is equipped with four brass threaded inserts on both the top and bottom surfaces.
These permit the fastening of the power unit cells and the respective adapter.
The location of the holes is the same for top and bottom surface (when viewed from the top).
As such, the same motor housing can be mounted on the top and bottom surface without alterations.
Furthermore, as presented in Figure \ref{fig:wing-insert}, the inserts are equidistant from the centreline positioned at half chord, thereby allowing the mounting of the same power unit cell (PUC) in tractor or pusher configurations without the need for alterations. 

\importimage{wing-insert}{section view of the wing insert.}{Wing insert}{0.9}

The tip insert is designed to mount the motor housing in a horizontal orientation.
In order to use the same configuration of mounting points the tip adaptor covers a structural role, unlike the others.
This presents the brass inserts configuration discussed above so to guarantee the attachment of the standardized PUC.  % TODO: clarify meaning
The adapter is then mounted to the insert though two M6 bolts fastened to the two imbedded nuts shown in Figure \ref{fig:ribs:tip}. 

In order to reduce the number of elements comprising the wing assembly, these components cover the function of ribs as well providing further torsional rigidity to the wing structure.
The two holes shown in Figure \ref{fig:wing-insert} permit the carbon spars to run through the rib insert, providing a secure attachment and sufficient bonding area.
Furthermore, as will be discussed in more detail later, the housing for the active surfaces' servos and flap guides are designed to be an integral part of the rib structure. 

\subsection{Mounting plate} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:wing:mounting-plate}

A nylon printed mounting plate is located at the centre of the wing assembly and is tightly mounted to the wing spars so as to guarantee a rigid support.
The wing assembly is then clamped onto the fuselage attachment plate by four M6 bolts.
These are positioned at the corners of the 3D printed plate as shown in Figure \ref{fig:wing-assembly}.
A styrofoam cover placed on top of the mounting plate is responsible for the blending of the wing assembly with the rest of the fuselage. 

\importimage{wing-assembly}{exploded view of the wing assembly attachment procedure}{Wing assembly attachment}{0.8}

The two cylinders housing the carbon spars (Figure \ref{fig:wing-plate:cad}) ensure an even distribution of the loads though a large area.
This is essential since this component is subject to the entirety of the load transferring from the wing to the fuselage and vice versa.
Extensive work was therefore conducted using finite element analysis to generate a reliable and light design.
The peak loading for this component was established to be $4g$, simulating an abrupt increase in lift as in Figure \ref{fig:wing-plate:fea}, and producing the optimal design that was eventually used.

\section{Fuselage} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage}

\subsection{Central structure} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:central-structure}

The main focus for the design of the UAV's fuselage was to provide a reliable and simple platform for the experiments.
The concept for the design of the fuselage revolved around the idea of providing easy access to the electronics.
Changing the motor configuration multiple times demands the ability to check and modify the electronics with ease in order to proceed with the experiments in a smooth manner.
The design therefore presents a large electronics tray placed in the lower section of the fuselage, shown in purple in Figure \ref{fig:fuselage-inner-structure}.
This can be accessed through the removal of the UAV's nose.

\importimage{fuselage-inner-structure}{CAD representation of the inner structure of the fuselage's central section.}{Fuselage inner structure}{0.8}

All of the fuselage's structural components are located in the top section of this part.
In so doing a large area was created for the housing of the electronics as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fuselage-inner-structure}.
The supports for the electronics tray, also referred as the fuselage ribs, were designed to be manufactured out of \mm{5} birch wood sheets.
Such supports (shown in brown in Figure \ref{fig:fuselage-inner-structure}) are mounted onto the fuselage central beam.
This is a square section carbon spar (\mm{20} $\times$ \mm{20}) which extends for the entire fuselage length. 

A carbon fibre sandwich panel is placed onto the top surface of the fuselage's central spar.
This is bonded at the wing's attachment area with the aid of epoxy bonding agent.
Its function is to provide the four mounting points for the bolts so as to allow the fixing of the wing assembly to the fuselage.
The sandwich panel is comprised of a \mm{5} thick nomex core placed between two carbon skins.
These are each made out of three ply woven carbon prepreg cured in autoclave.
Mounted below the plate are two PLA printed brackets (Figure \ref{fig:pla-bracket}); these are responsible for the correct positioning of the fuselage ribs and the landing gear mounting structure (Figure \ref{fig:brackets-highlighted}).
Furthermore, they are designed to withstand a vertical load of \newtons{170} each, thus offering a redundant attachment for the mounting plate in case of failure.

\importimage{pla-bracket}{CAD representation of the PLA bracket.}{PLA bracket}{0.5}
\importimage{brackets-highlighted}{fuselage central assembly with brackets highlighted in green.}{Highlighted brackets}{0.7}

\subsection{Landing gear attachment} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:landing-gear-attachment}

The aircraft was designed to not exceed \kg{7} of total mass.
Hence the position and the mass of the landing gear structure proved to be of significance in positioning the aircraft's centre of gravity.
Its ideal position was set to be at \pc{50} of the wing's chord length, with a \pc{5} shift caused by the change in propulsion configuration.
The landing gear is mounted on two C-shaped \mm{5} aluminium brackets.
These are mounted to two bulkheads as shown in Figure \ref{fig:landing-gear-attachment}, and fulfil the role of transferring and absorbing the vertical loads encountered during taxi, takeoff, and landing.
In order to minimise the weight of this structure the bulkheads were designed to be manufactured as carbon fibre sandwich panels.
These have been specified to withstand vertical loads up to $5g$.
Furthermore, two triangular braces, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:landing-gear-attachment:side}, are attached to the lowest section of the bulkheads and are clamped to the main spar through a PLA insert.
These work in compression and are designed to counteract the moments generated by the loads acting on the wheels in the direction of travel.

The carbon fibre sandwich panels bulkheads were designed in the same manner as the aforementioned fuselage central plate, whose schematic can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:carbon-fibre-sandwich}. 

\importimage{carbon-fibre-sandwich}{CAD representation of the carbon fibre sandwich panel components.}{Carbon fibre sandwich}{0.5}

\subsection{Finite element analysis} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:fuselage:finite-element-analysis}

In order to verify the strength of the design and identify any weak points, some FEA was carried out using the simulation function in SolidWorks.
This is a fairly basic FEA system and can only use coarse meshes $-$ otherwise the simulations fail $-$ but it gives a good indication of the strong and weak areas of the fuselage design.
The materials of the parts of the fuselage were all specified and the data for those materials applied as accurately as possible in order to ensure the parts' relative strengths were reflected in the simulations.
The model was stripped down to the minimum components required to perform the simulations in order to save computational time and simplify the simulations.
Initially a simulation was run to test the effects of high turning loads, with the main tail boom fixed in place as the reference point of the study, with loads of \newtons{210} applied vertically upwards on the wing spar holes in the wing mount, and \newtons{80} applied vertically down on the component tray.
These loads were chosen to simulate $3g$ loads in a turn, with the mass of the components assumed to be evenly distributed over the tray.
Figure \ref{fig:fuselage-stress-distribution} shows the results.

\importimage{fuselage-stress-distribution}{fuselage stress distribution during a simulated $3g$ turn.}{Fuselage stress distribution}{0.7}

It can be seen that the wing mount shows that the maximum stress experienced is around 1.6 MPa, which is significantly below the 30 MPa yield stress of the ABS material used.
The other high stress locations are on the lower parts of the component tray mounts, which peak at over 2 MPa, but the plywood used has a yield stress of 30 MPa and so this is also well below the point of breaking.
It can also be seen that the stress on the carbon fibre tail boom reaches over 2 MPa, but this is well below the yield stress of the carbon tube which will be over 600 MPa based on the properties quoted at \cite{unknown}. % TODO: [Performance Composites [REF]]. 

The second simulation determined the effects of landing loads, with the tail boom again fixed and the loads applied at the locations of the wheel centres on the landing gear.
This simulation only tested the main gear as this is where the highest forces should be experienced if the UAV is landed properly.
The forces applied are \newtons{350} vertically up and \newtons{105} horizontally backwards to simulate a heavy landing of $5g$ with $1.5g$ deceleration force. 

\importimage{landing-leg-simulation}{simulated stress distribution over one of the landing legs.}{Landing leg simulation}{0.4}
\importimage{fuselage-landing-simulation}{stress distribution over the fuselage during a simulated landing.}{Fuselage landing simulation}{0.6}

It can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:landing-leg-simulaion} that the peak loads experienced by the landing gear are around 260 MPa, which is below the yield stress of the carbon fibre as previously stated, and although it is nearing the yield stress, this is an extreme case of a particularly heavy landing and so a heavier landing than this would not be expected unless it occurs in a crash landing scenario (in which case the UAV's survival can never be guaranteed).
It can also be seen that the peak stress on the landing gear brackets is around 100 MPa, below the yield stress of around 270 MPa of the aluminium from which they are made.
With the scale modified to a reduced upper bound, the stresses on the other parts can be seen, with the peak stress experienced by the landing gear mounts seen as around 10 MPa, which is far below the yield stress of carbon fibre and so $-$ although the properties of carbon fibre sandwich panel are varied $-$ this is not close to failure. 

\section{Landing gear} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:landing-gear}

Using a similar process to that used in the original tail wheel design, it was calculated that the main landing gear would experience up to \newtons{105.8} on landing.  % TODO: add section reference if reordered
The main gear in the final design proposal is located behind the centre of gravity, behind the internal electronics.
This, along with a redesigned fuselage means the landing gear could be designed as a single part and attached easily to the bottom of the fuselage. 

% \importimage{main-gear-design}{main gear design.}{Main gear design}{0.4}
\importimage{main-gear-fea}{main gear FEA stress results.}{Main gear FEA}{0.6}

The main shape of the design remains unchanged from the initial design, and is a similar design to that seen on many small UAVs which is simple, easy to implement, and robust.
The final design is expected to experience a maximum stress of 92.5 MPa on a rough landing, and is manufactured from carbon fibre because it can be manufactured cheaply in university workshops and has a high strength to weight ratio.
The final design has a maximum thickness of \mm{6} at the top where it joins the fuselage, narrowing to \mm{4} by the wheels.
The depth remained constant at \mm{65}, with a wheelbase of \mm{490} and a height of \mm{220} to avoid hitting the under-rudder on takeoff.
The redesigned fuselage structure with two lower plates means that the landing gear can easily be mounted to the fuselage using two M4 bolts. 

Eventually, a landing gear model very similar to the one described here was found online and purchased instead of manufacturing one from scratch; this was found to be more time- and cost-effective.

\importimage{landing-gear-join}{landing gear joining mechanism.}{Landing gear joining mechanism}{0.6}

The nose gear was chosen at the recommendation of the project co-supervisor and is the same as the one used on the SPOTTER aircraft \cite{spotter-19}, a \kg{24} split fuselage UAV.
It is easy to implement into the nose and is steerable, while also being cheap, lightweight, and strong. 

\section{Nose} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:nose}

The final design of the nose incorporates a steerable landing gear.
This part of the design was carefully considered throughout the design process, but only fully implemented after the landing gear design had been finalised. 

% \importimage{steerable-gear}{integration of the steerable nose gear.}{Steerable nose gear}{0.7}

Figure \ref{fig:nose-design:steerable-nose-gear} shows how the nose gear is incorporated within the vent design.
The nose gear is secured using two collars, one above and one below the thicker part of the nose, as well as one to secure the servo arm in place.
The servo arm is attached to the servo via two springs, which alleviate impacts and prevent the nose from rapid direction changes due to bumps.
The servo is bolted onto the battery tray, to one side, to allow space for the battery tray to be removed. 

As mentioned during the analysis of the landing gear, depending on the configuration, the landing gear will have to withstand a force of up to around \newtons{35} on landing.
Therefore, further FEA was carried out on the nose.
The results (Figure \ref{fig:nose-connection-fea}) show a moderate level of stress on the wall at the bottom of the vent, although this was about half of the perceived yield strength of the SLS nylon which is to be used. 

\importimage{nose-connection-fea}{FEA on nose and landing gear connection.}{Nose connection FEA}{0.7}

When the nose motor is not needed it can be removed and replaced with a small insert.
The hollow insert is to be 3D printed on the university 3D printer using PLA as it is not a structural component.
It was designed to be screwed in in the same manner as the motor. 

\importimage{nose-motor-filler}{nose motor filler.}{Nose motor filler}{0.5}

\section{Tail} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:tail}

% TODO: rewrite this? To describe the final tail design?

The tail surface CAD was generated as a lofted base using aerofoil profiles of a NACA0012 with a scaling factor applied to make a NACA0018, lining up at the trailing edge.
The root was shortened to allow for the tail mount geometry, and cutouts were added for the tail spars, control surfaces, and hot wire routes.
Initially the control surfaces were to be pinned into place with a laser cut sheet bonded to the end of the lifting surface holding a pin extending into control surface for it to rotate around, but in order to facilitate disassembly of the tail sub-assembly, this was changed into a 3D printed component that would neatly hold a nut on the end of a threaded rod bonded to the end of the tail spar.

The tail surfaces were designed to be inserted into 3D printed component as it was realised that the tail would require a lot of functionality that would be hard to facilitate with a foam or set of laser cut parts.
This was decided to be a piece that would split in half vertically, allowing the vertical surfaces to be inserted easily, and the horizontal surfaces would require a small amount of trimming to allow them to slide in over the spars, before being secured using bolts.
The CAD process for the final version of the tail mount can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:tail-mount-progression}.

\end{figure} 

The process began with a tapered section hollowed out to \mm{1.5} wall thickness, and a rectangular tube added for the tail spar.
The inside and outside corners were filleted. 
Next, ribs were added for lightweight structural support, made by a complex series of combined bodies.
Supporting structure was added from the outside walls to meet the spar tube in the centre.
A mounting location was added for the tail motor, and channels to run securing bolts through were added, as it was intended to make the part in two halves to aid assembly.  
In an assembly, the tail lifting surfaces were added, and moved to the correct position using mates, and then their bodies were subtracted from the mount body. 

Servo mounts were added and a motor mounting solution added based on a teammates previous design, and then a shroud was added over the motor, as well as a wire route for the motor connections.
The structure was eventually split in half and holes for spars added, and the model tidied up for 3D printing. 
A small structure was added to the front to allow for mounting to the foam ahead of it.

Finally, a small 3D printed part was designed to fit into the attachment location at the rear of the tail mount.
This was based on a prior design from earlier on in the project's design process, and simply had a cylinder with wide radial teeth protruding from the inside.
The motor mount had the same teeth, and would slide axially in the cylinder through the gaps, and then rotate, the teeth overlapping to prevent the mount from moving.
Small holes cut through both parts of the mount allowed for threaded inserts to be placed inside, and then screws through the same holes would secure the mount in place.

\section{Electronics} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:electronics}

% TODO: split into subsubsections

While a Futaba transmitter was originally to be loaned from the university, scheduling constraints resulted in its unavailability for the duration of the project.
As an alternative, a FrSky Taranis X9D was purchased upon recommendation of its being a good tradeoff between price and flexibility.
The model is widely used and compatible with a wide range of receivers, uses a standard communication protocol, and also runs a configurable operating system, OpenTx, which enables it to be programmed in Lua.
As well as the standard joysticks, the handset has triggers and switches which can be mapped to the flaps and autopilot channels. 

Two primary factors constrained the selection of receiver.
The first was the output method, which needed to be SBUS to be compatible with the Matek flight controller, and have at least eight output channels.
The second was compatibility with the Taranis transmitter, which ruled out a number of Futaba receivers operating on a proprietary communication protocol. 

Other factors, while less important, included the power usage, cost, and size of the receiver.
The receiver was intended to fit onto an electronics tray along with the flight controller, and would be powered by the same battery as the flight controller, microcontroller, and servos.
A receiver, the FrSky X8R, was found, operating on 100mA at 5V (the standardised output voltage of the flight controller), and weighing less than 20g.
Its profile is also similar to that of the flight controller, meaning that it would not be the limiting factor in the size and shape of the electronics tray when the fuselage was designed. 

When bound to a Taranis X9D, the X8R is capable of receiving sixteen independent channels via FrSky’s radio transfer protocol ACCESS (a newer and more robust version of ACCST).
This would be more than sufficient for the eight channels required as a baseline for the project, and would also leave room for the expansion of the project with additional features, as mentioned previously, with the eight leftover channels.
The operating range of 1.5km would also be more than sufficient for the project. 

As well as being compatible with the Taranis transmitter and capable of outputting to SBUS, the receiver had a number of serial ports (standard PWM outputs) which could be used for testing and validating its functionality without having to pass the signals through the flight controller first.
It was thought that this could be useful in the later stages of the project while troubleshooting any issues, being able to remove the flight controller from the loop and isolate the receiver to check that it was communicating properly with the transmitter. 

All moveable surfaces on the aircraft are actuated by servos.
These are split into four groups: ailerons, elevators, rudder, and flaps.
The first three are the control surfaces by which the aircraft is controlled, and would need to be sized for a fairly limited selection of manoeuvres.
It was not expected that the aircraft would be performing any tight turns, but the load that would be transferred through the aileron servos could depend greatly on the configuration of the propulsion modules.
With the modules located at the end of the wings, the greatly increased moment of inertia of the aircraft would mean that actuating the ailerons would not produce nearly as much inertial relief as when the motors and batteries were located on the centreline.
As such, the servos could be expected to see a fairly variable range of loads.
In addition, the loads experienced by the rudder servos was found to be far in excess of the loads experienced by all other servos when the possibility of an asymmetric motor failure at the wingtips was considered.
It was decided that these servos would need to be of a different type to those elsewhere in the aircraft. 

In all, fourteen servos would be required to control the aircraft, including the two servos of different specification for the rudder.
The exact configuration of these servos, as well as the signals passed to each of them, is shown below. 

\importimage{signal-splitters}{control signal splitter schematic.}{Signal splitter schematic}{0.7}

Note that each flap is supported by two servos of opposing deflection directions.
While the flaps increase the lift of the aircraft quite dramatically, and thereby exert a large moment onto their supporting servos, the distribution of this load across four flap segments and eight servos meant that the smaller servo size was capable of holding the flaps in place during takeoff and landing. 

One potential issue with the servos selected was the degradation of the plastic-toothed gears they use.
Information from peers suggested that sufficient use would wear the gears down and reduce their effective strength, causing the gears to slide at a smaller load than suggested by the servos’ data sheets.
An experiment was devised to repetitively test a servo under load (actuating it far more times than would ever be expected of a servo in a flight model) to see whether its strength afterwards was the same as upon its delivery; but this experiment was never carried out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the event that it had been found to significantly impact the strength of the servos, metal-toothed servos could have been purchased at a slightly higher cost. 

The entirety of the electronics subsystem was to be powered by a single battery, referred to as the avionics battery.
This would be connected to the flight controller, powering it directly, and indirectly powering the receiver, microcontroller, and servos.
While throttle signals would be supplied to the motors from the flight controller directly, the bulk of their power would come from the ESCs, which are in turn powered by the battery local to that propulsion module. 

In order to size the battery used for the avionics, the approximate power draw of each of the electrical components needed to be determined.
Research was conducted, considering the following items drawing power during a typical 10-minute flight: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Servos
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Draw 10mA while idle, 100-250mA while moving, and have a stall current of 360mA 
            \item The stall torque of the servos being used is 1.7kg.cm, meaning that for a 4cm control surface, a load of roughly 0.5kg would need to be applied to cause a stall.
                Considering that there are nine control surfaces and that the total lift generated by the aircraft is around 7kg, it can reasonably be assumed that the likelihood of any individual control surface experiencing a load of 0.5kg is extremely small; certainly small enough that it will occur only momentarily and does not need to be factored into the draw calculations 
            \item 8 servos are being used for the flaps and so will only move for a few seconds per flight 
            \item One servo connected to the nose gear, which will likely only be moving periodically within two 30-second windows at the start and end of each flight 
            \item 5 servos are connected to the control surfaces.
                It is assumed that control surfaces will only move for around 50\% of the time while in the air.
                To build in a bit of redundancy and account for the movement of the flap/gear servos, it is assumed that the power drain from servos will be equivalent to five servos moving constantly 
            \item This then means 1000mA drawn by servos 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Receiver: listed as drawing a continuous 100mA 
    \item Flight controller: listed as drawing a continuous 500mA, a conservative estimate 
    \item The exact current draw of a microcontroller is difficult to determine as it depends primarily on how much the processor is being used.
        Even conservative estimates resulted in around 20mA of draw, so that was neglected here as it is so much smaller than the other components 
\end{itemize}

An additional constraint placed on the battery was the required voltage of between 9 and 30 volts.  As the battery needs to be a LiPo battery, this limited the selection to those with between 3 and 6 cells. 

Given a total of 1600mA drawn while in flight (a conservative estimate which also accounts for the small amount of additional power used for one-off events during takeoff and landing), and the voltage requirements, a few batteries were found which could power the avionics.
Several higher-capacity batteries were heavier and more expensive and, while they would enable multiple flights on one battery, switching out multiple lower-capacity batteries which were both lighter and cheaper was found to be more cost- and mass-effective, and also in keeping with the modular nature of the project. 

The battery settled on was therefore a 450mA, 11.1V, and 65-130C discharge, which should provide for at least 15 minutes of flight on a conservative estimate of the power draw.
Its low cost means that multiple can be bought and swapped out between flights, while used batteries are recharged. 

With all the components of the avionics subsystem specified, a wiring diagram could be created and from this an iron bird constructed.
The primary goal of this exercise was to check that every required component was present, and that they would all fit together with the necessary wires. 

\importimage{wiring-diagram}{wiring diagram for the avionics subsystem.}{Wiring diagram}{0.6}

From the above diagram, the iron bird was built onto a miniaturised cutout of the same general shape as the full-size aircraft. 

\importimage{iron-bird}{iron bird.}{Iron bird}{0.7}

While not all of the servos were included in the iron bird, each servo group was represented.
The iron bird also gave a much clearer indication of roughly how much wiring would be needed to connect the various groups, and which layout would be most efficient for splitting the signals; that is, which signals should be brought down each of the main “limbs” of the aircraft, and where should they be split.
Once this was decided, the splitters could be designed and manufactured. 

\importimage{splitter-schematic}{manufacturing schematic for a single splitter.}{Manufacturing schematic}{0.5}

A schematic similar to the one shown above was drawn out for each of the splitters identified in Figure \ref{fig:splitter-schematic}.
This includes the specification of the splitter in terms of the signals designated as inputs and outputs, and shows its layout in terms of header pins (rectangular boxes) soldered (ovals) across a stripboard whose strips are assumed to go across the page horizontally.
Breaks in the stripboard are shown here by small vertical lines instead of a dot representing the corresponding hole. 

These splitters were manufactured from small cut segments of stripboard by simply soldering header pins in the correct locations.
The seven splitters also had small outcrops of stripboard so that they could be fastened to relevant locations throughout the body of the aircraft.

Although the full electronics system was never assembled in the UAV due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all of the necessary physical components were purchased and manufactured, and their compatibility was tested in the iron bird.

Before the electronics were to be flown on the UAV, they needed to be tested.
There was thorough testing of the electronics out of any aircraft first, but in order to be deemed flight worthy it needed to be tested in the air in a sacrificial flight vehicle.
The foamy selection was based on the constraints of the fuselage size required in order to have room to fit all of the electronics inside, keeping the cost as low as possible, and having an aircraft that we could fly ourselves (easy to fly for beginners).
The fuselage needed to be able to fit all of the necessity electronics; battery, ESC, receiver, as well as our additional electronics to control the autopilot; Arduino, Matek, and GPS.
Therefore we needed a beginners plane that had excess fuselage space, and so we chose the Bixler 3 as it has a large internal space for the necessity electronics, as well as an empty nose for installation of a camera for FPV flying, and this space would be suitable for fitting in our additional electronics.
Additionally the plane is designed for beginners and so has a large surface area wing for low speed flying, high mounted for flight stability, the motor and propeller face rearwards above the fuselage to get them out of the way of damage in the event of a crash, and the underside of the fuselage is strengthened to act as a skid if the landing gear comes off in a particularly heavy landing.
All of this makes it ideal for our use case.
However, it was not flow due to the coronavirus lockdown, and so the electronics could not be flight tested.

\section{Propulsion} \label{sec:final-design-proposal:propulsion}

% TODO: rewrite in the present tense, more descriptive?

The design of the housing for the motors and its subsidiary systems focused on permitting the repositioning of these system in a small time window without the need for alteration to the design, thereby increasing the number of flights that can be completed in one day.
This was crucial so that the difference in atmospheric conditions are reduced to minimum. 
The use of the PUC design allowed the reduction of wires running through the wing as well as making those components more accessible for maintenance.
Furthermore, the use of a compact design allowed for a standard PUC which could be used in all wing propulsion configurations.
This was achieved by creating a standard simple profile for the surfaces normal to the attachment points; this is evident in Figure \ref{fig:puc-assemblies}.
In order to guarantee a smooth passage of the flow around the housing an adapter is created for each configuration.
This slots onto the standardized surfaces of the power unit cell and mounts directly on the wing surfaces blending the two together.
Furthermore, they ensure that the thrust line in unvaried between tractor and pusher configurations.

The distance from the trailing edge to the propeller in the pusher layout is equivalent to the distance from the leading edge to the propeller in the tractor layout.
Moreover, as in can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:puc-assemblies}, the attachment holes for the mounting bolts remain in the same position despite the change in arrangement, thereby allowing propulsion layouts to be changed without modifying the components. 
The power unit cells are also split in two components: a front section and a rear section, permitting to access the components stored inside with the removal of the four M4 bolts securing the two halves together.
Four threaded inserts imbedded in the nylon structure of the front section allow the fitting of the motor.
The battery and the ESC are instead slotted into the rear section of the cell.
The open section into which the ESC is placed ensures the cooling of this component in all configurations setup, avoiding common reliability issues caused by overheated ESCs.
An exploded view of the PUC assembly is shown in Figure \ref{fig:puc-assemblies:exploded}. 

% \importimage{puc-exploded}{exploded view of the PUC assembly.}{Exploded PUC}{0.6}

Due to the fitting of the battery and the ESC, the PUC assembly has a significant weight.
In fact, the CG of the UAV is subject to a noticeable shift as the motor configuration is changed from tractor to pusher.
A reduction in this effect leads to a less significant need to rely on a ballast to maintain the CG in the same location. 
In order to alleviate this effect, the battery was located closer to half chord length with some compromises made for the aerodynamic aspect.
Further lightweighting work produced more efficient components through the use of ribs and reinforcements, where loads concentrate, and thin walls as shown in Figure \ref{fig:puc-design:rear}.
This resulted into an overall housing dry weight of 207 g.
